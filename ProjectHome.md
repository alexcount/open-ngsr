This Project plans to create a small "super-regulator" type supply well suited to digital, analog, and mixed signal circuits. Plans are to improve upon the Walt Jung Super Regulator, with a priority on extremely low impedance across a wide frequency band, in addition to very low noise.

## Goals ##
  * Low Impedance over a wide frequency band (0hz-1ghz)
  * Low Noise (under 1uv)
  * Shunt and Series type regulators (one might be better suited for analog/digital)
  * very small profile PCB (under 1" square)
  * all SMD components
  * 3 wire interface (in/out/ground)
  * full documentation released under gnu gpl v2
  * Gerber files released under open license
  * Full specifications will be tested and published


### What Will this Project Develop? ###
This project will develop Gerber files for a PCB, in addition to documentation and specifications.
### Will you sell Kits? ###
Kits might become available if enough interest is created.
===Will PCB's be sold eventually?
PCB's will be available once developed.

### Open-NGDI ###
This is a sister project of the Open-NGDI or Open Next-Gen Digital Interface, which is an Open-Hardware project that plans to create a general-purpose high speed digital interface of the highest quality.
